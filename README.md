# AfricentricQRcodes
In response to a request to have an interactive component for an Africentric conference at York University--it was called Indaba: The Gathering--I created a QR code game. In the Akan culture, a nation-group in Ghana, there are names for the day of week one is born, they are referred to as day names. Each visitor found their year of birth on their phone or on Ipads provided, then scanned 1 of 7 QR codes that corresponded to days of the week. The QR code then lead to one of the partners website that revealed their name for the day and a horoscope-like description of what their name means spiritually.
